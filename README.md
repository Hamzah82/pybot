# Pybot

Pybot is a personal AI assistant created by me and developed by **Nebula Enterprise**. Pybot is designed to provide intelligent, efficient, and polite answers to users. Every interaction with Pybot is **stateless**, meaning conversations are not stored to maintain security and optimal performance.

## Key Features
âœ… **No Chat History** â†’ Every conversation is always considered new. 
âœ… **Encrypted Model** â†’ Model files are encrypted so that they cannot be read by humans directly. 
âœ… **Focus on Useful Answers** â†’ Avoids irrelevant or useless conversations. 
âœ… **Not Easily Influenced** â†’ Pybot will not easily believe if a user claims to be its creator. 
âœ… **Light & Fast** â†’ Does not burden the system with chat log storage.
